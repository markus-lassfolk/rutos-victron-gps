# Security Notes

## Credentials Management

### RUTOS Authentication
The Enhanced Victron GPS Control flow requires RUTOS router credentials for GPS data access. 

**Important Security Considerations:**

1. **Replace Default Credentials**: The flow contains placeholder credentials that must be updated:
   - Username: `admin` (default RUTOS admin user)
   - Password: `YOUR_RUTOS_PASSWORD_HERE` (must be replaced with your actual password)

2. **Secure Credential Storage**: For production deployments, consider:
   - Using Node-RED credential management features
   - Environment variables for containerized deployments
   - External credential stores or vaults

3. **Network Security**: 
   - Ensure MQTT connections use appropriate authentication
   - Consider TLS/SSL for sensitive communications
   - Restrict network access to GPS APIs when possible

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying these flows:

1. [ ] Replace `YOUR_RUTOS_PASSWORD_HERE` with your actual RUTOS password
2. [ ] Verify MQTT broker authentication settings
3. [ ] Test all credential-dependent flows in a secure environment
4. [ ] Consider implementing credential rotation policies
5. [ ] Document access requirements for team members

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover security vulnerabilities in these flows, please report them responsibly by:
1. Not committing sensitive credentials to version control
2. Using secure communication channels for credential sharing
3. Following your organization's security incident response procedures
