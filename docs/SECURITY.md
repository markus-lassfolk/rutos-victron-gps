# Security Best Practices

This document outlines security considerations and best practices for the RUTOS Victron GPS Integration.

## üîê Credential Management

### Recommended: Node-RED Context Store

The most secure method for storing router credentials:

```javascript
// In a temporary Node-RED function node (delete after use):
flow.set('rutos_credentials', {
    username: 'your_router_admin',
    password: 'your_secure_password'
});
```

**Benefits:**
- Encrypted storage within Node-RED
- Survives Node-RED restarts
- Not visible in flow exports
- Isolated from other applications

### Alternative: Environment Variables

For system-wide credential management:

```bash
# On Venus OS command line:
export RUTOS_USERNAME="your_username"
export RUTOS_PASSWORD="your_password"

# Make persistent (add to profile):
echo 'export RUTOS_USERNAME="your_username"' >> ~/.profile
echo 'export RUTOS_PASSWORD="your_password"' >> ~/.profile
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Network Security

### MQTT Security

- **Local Network**: Ensure MQTT broker is only accessible on trusted networks
- **Authentication**: Use MQTT authentication if available
- **TLS**: Consider TLS encryption for MQTT in sensitive environments

### HTTP Endpoints

- **Router Access**: Limit RUTOS router access to management network only
- **Starlink**: Starlink gRPC typically local only (192.168.100.1)
- **Firewall**: Configure Venus OS firewall appropriately

## üîí Venus OS Security

### System Access

- **SSH Keys**: Use SSH keys instead of passwords for remote access
- **User Accounts**: Create dedicated user accounts, avoid using root
- **Network Access**: Restrict network access to Node-RED interface

### Node-RED Security

- **Authentication**: Enable Node-RED authentication:

```javascript
// In Node-RED settings.js:
adminAuth: {
    type: "credentials",
    users: [{
        username: "admin",
        password: "$2b$08$...", // bcrypt hash
        permissions: "*"
    }]
}
```

- **HTTPS**: Enable HTTPS for Node-RED interface in production
- **Session Security**: Configure secure session management

## üìä Monitoring and Auditing

### Log Monitoring

Monitor Node-RED logs for:
- Authentication failures
- Unexpected network access attempts  
- GPS data anomalies
- System resource usage

### Access Logging

Enable logging for:
- Node-RED interface access
- MQTT connection attempts
- Router authentication attempts
- System command execution

## üö® Incident Response

### Security Incident Checklist

1. **Isolate System**: Disconnect from network if compromise suspected
2. **Change Credentials**: Update all passwords and API keys
3. **Review Logs**: Analyze system and application logs
4. **Update System**: Apply security patches and updates
5. **Restore from Backup**: Use clean backup if necessary

### Backup Strategy

Regular backups of:
- Node-RED flows and configuration
- Venus OS system configuration
- GPS configuration and credentials
- Network and security settings

## üîÑ Regular Maintenance

### Security Updates

- **Venus OS**: Keep updated with latest security patches
- **Node-RED**: Update Node-RED and node modules regularly
- **Router Firmware**: Keep RUTOS firmware updated
- **Credential Rotation**: Regularly change passwords and keys

### Security Audit

Periodic review of:
- User access and permissions
- Network configurations
- Log files and access patterns
- Backup and recovery procedures

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warnings

### Do Not:

- **Hardcode Credentials**: Never embed passwords directly in flows
- **Share Exports**: Flow exports may contain sensitive data
- **Public Networks**: Avoid connecting to untrusted networks
- **Default Passwords**: Always change default system passwords

### Best Practices:

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Defense in Depth**: Use multiple security layers
- **Regular Monitoring**: Continuously monitor system security
- **Documentation**: Keep security documentation current

## üìû Support and Reporting

### Security Issues

Report security vulnerabilities:
- Create GitHub issue (for non-sensitive issues)
- Contact maintainer directly (for sensitive issues)
- Include detailed description and reproduction steps
- Allow reasonable time for response and remediation

### Getting Help

For security configuration assistance:
- Check troubleshooting documentation
- Review Venus OS security documentation
- Consult Victron Energy support resources
- Engage with community forums (avoid sharing sensitive details)

**Remember**: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup. Regularly review and update your security measures.
